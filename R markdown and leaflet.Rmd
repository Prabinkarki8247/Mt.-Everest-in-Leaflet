Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!
```{r}
library(leaflet)
my_map <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  
  addMarkers(lng=86.922623, lat=27.986065, popup = "Mt. Everest, Nepal")
my_map 
```
